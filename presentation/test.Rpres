Why do not present some data with some graphs and slider and so on?
========================================================


- I have no data I wish to share
- tweaking Shiny to do what it's not built to do seems interesting
- give some fun project for peers to review (and for me to do!)
- I'm fan of certain postapocalyptic RPG game series, so this is a kind of tribute


What is the app about
========================================================

- the app game is very simple 
- takes inspiration from the tributed games to (re)create the Temple of Trials
- uses Shiny's functions to let user go through the trials (e.g. do actions):
<ul>
        <li><strong>radioButtons</strong> let user chose which path he wishes to go</li>
        
        <li><strong>conditionalPanel</strong> appear after their condition is fulfilled, only one condition per panel is possible</li>
        
        <li><strong>actionButtons</strong> are triggers for conditional panels</li>
</ul>


How to play
========================================================

- follow the instructions :)
- chose your abilities (strength, agility, intelligence)
- test your abilities against opponents
- win your way out of the Temple of Trials

Game mechanics
========================================================


- fight system is based on roll of dices
- number of spent ability points is number of dice rolls
- opponents have one or two dice rolls
- larger sum of rolls wins (equality is a victory for player)

```{r}
opponent <- (sample(1:6, 1, replace = T)); you<- (sum((sample(1:6, 3, replace = T))))
        #in place of 3 there is input from user in the app
winLose <- as.character(opponent <= you)
df<-data.frame(opponent, you, winLose); colnames(df) <- c("Your opponent", "You", "Do you win?")
df
```
